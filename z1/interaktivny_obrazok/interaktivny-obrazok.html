                    <h3>Conrad</h3>
                    <p>
                        In comparison to the rest of the God Hand, Conrad is the least developed personality-wise.
                        He is a stoic, impassive, and passionate individual who prefers his cohorts to do the talking
                        during rituals. Conrad's seemingly only desire is to spread pestilence to the mortal world
                        through diseased rodents and other dirty creatures.

                        the overarching antagonist of both the Black Swordsman arc and Conviction arc and a pivotal

                    <h3>Ubik</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ubik does most of the talking when the God Hand is present, providing much exposition. His role
                        appears to be to convince the would-be apostle to accept the God Hand's sacrificial bargain by
                        tempting them and convincing them that they cannot move forward without losing something of
                        value. Ubik never outright lies, but will manipulate and twist the truth to push his victims
                        closer to accepting the deal.

                    <p>
                        Slan is a member of the God Hand and a major antagonist in Berserk. She takes on the form of a
                        succubus with black leathery wings and vine-like hair. She is a sadomasochist who thrives on
                        cruelty and the effect it has on those who observe it. She appears to have a fascination with
                        Guts when she manifests in the Qlippoth to confront him, having as well shown an interest in his
                        incredible strength and survivability when the Count summoned the God Hand. Her name is borrowed
                        from A. E. van Vogt's Slan.
